# GCS

## Overview

This repository contains a small project created as part of my participation in a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge.  
While the project is basic in terms of functionality, it demonstrates my practical problem-solving skills and approach to security-related challenges.

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to tackle a specific task in a CTF competition, allowing me to practice real-world cybersecurity concepts and coding techniques.  
It is a showcase of my ability to work under constraints and solve problems efficiently, even in a simplified context.

## Structure

- The repository contains minimal commits and files:
  - CTF-related code and scripts
  - README file

## Professional Context

Although this is a simple project, making it public allows others to see my engagement with security challenges and my approach to practical problem-solving.  
It is a small but tangible example of my experience in programming and cybersecurity exercises.

## Notes

- This project does **not contain any sensitive information, keys, or credentials**.
- It is primarily intended as a portfolio piece to demonstrate hands-on experience and participation in security-focused challenges.
